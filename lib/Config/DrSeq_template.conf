### Description of parameters in [General]
# [required]barcode_file : Fastq file only, by default, every barcode in fastq file consist of 20 bp including 12bp cell barcode(1-12bp) and 8bp UMI(13-20bp). cell barcode should locate before UMI, the range of cell barcode and UMI can be defined below. Note that cell barcode should locate before UMI
# cell_barcode_range/umi_range: Location of cell barcode and UMI, (see the annotation of barcoe_fastq). by default they are 1:12 and 13:20. For example, if the barcode in your fastq is AAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCC, then the cell_barcode of this reads is A 1:12 and the UMI is C 13:20 
# [required]reads_file: Accept raw sequencing file (fastq) or aligned file(sam), file type is specified by extension. (regard as raw file and add mapping step if .fastq, regard as aligned file and skip alignment step if .sam), sam file should be with header
# [required]outputdirectory: Directory for all result. default is current dir "." if user left it blank  , but not recommended. 
# [required]outname: Name of all your output results, your results will looks like outname.pdf, outname.txt
# [required]gene_annotation: Gene model in full text format, download from UCSC genome browser, eg:  /yourfolder/mm10_refgenes.txt.
# png_for_dot: Only works for dotplots in individual cell QC. set 1 to plot dotplots in individual cell QC in png format, otherwise they will be plotted in pdf format. the format of other plots are fixed to pdf, because their file size are not so big. 
#     Make sure your Rscript is able to generate PNG plots if you turn on this function. Default is NO (use pdf for all plots)

[Step1_Mapping]
mapping_software_main = HISAT2
checkmem = 1
mapping_p = 8
mapindex = /home/user/hisat2_index
q30filter = 1

### Description of parameters in [Step1_Mapping]
# [required if reads file is FASTQ format]mapping_software_main: name of your mapping software, choose from HISAT2, STAR and bowtie2 (case sensitive), hisat2(STAR or bowtie2) should be installed in your default PATH, see Manual
# checkmem: (only take effect when mapping_software_main = STAR) Dr.seq will check your total memory to make sure its greater 40G if you choose STAR as mapping tool. We don't suggest to run STAR on Mac. You can turn off (set 0) this function if you prefer STAR regardless of your memory (which may cause crash down of your computer)
# mapping_p: Number of alignment threads to launch alignment software
# [required if reads file is FASTQ format]mapindex: Mapping index of your alignment tool, , 
#     Mapping index should be built before you run this pipeline, note that STAR and bowtie2 use different index type(see STAR/bowtie2 document for more details.). 
#     For STAR, mapindex should be the folder you built STAR index, this parameter will be directly used as the mapping index parameter of STAR
#     eg: /mnt/Storage3/mapping_idnex/mm10.star (then uner your folder /mnt/Storage3/mapping_idnex/mm10.star/  there should be STAR index files)
#     For bowtie2, mapindex should be index filename prefix (minus trailing .X.bt2).this parameter will be directly used as the mapping index parameter of bowtie2
#     eg: /mnt/Storage3/mapping_index/mm10.bowtie2/mm10  (then under your folder  /mnt/Storage3/mapping_index/mm10.bowtie2/  there should be mm10.1.bt2, mm10.rev.1.bt2 ....  ), 
# q30filter: Use q30 criteria (Phred quality scores) to filter reads in samfile, set this parameter to 1(default) to turn on this option, set 0 to turn off. Default is 1


[Step2_ExpMat]
filterttsdistance = 0
ttsdistance = 400
covergncutoff = 100
duplicate_measure = 2
umidis1 = 0

### Description of parameters in [Step2_ExpMat]
# filterttsdistance: Whether discard reads far away from tts, choose from  0 or 1, set 1 to turn on this function, default is 0 (not use),  
# ttsdistance: Default filter distance is 400bp, only take effect when filterttsdistance = 1 is set
# covergncutoff: Only plot cell barcodes with more than 100 (default) genes covered in the dotplots in individual-cell QC step.
#     Note that this parameter is only for visualization of QC report and convenience of following analysis, because too many cell_barcodes will influence users' interpretation of the QC report.
#     Users can change this parameter when the drop-seq sample don't have enouth coverage/read depth
#     To determine "STAMP barcodes" from cell barcodes for clustering, users can change parameter in [Step4_Analysis] "covergncluster"
# duplicate_measure: method to consider duplicate reads in each cell barcodes when generate expression matrix, 
#     1 : combine duplicate reads with same UMI and same genomic location (position and strand)
#     2(default) : only consider UMI (combine duplicate reads with same UMI)
#     3 : only consider genomic location only (combine duplicate reads with same genomic location)
#     0 : do not remove(combine) duplicate reads (keep all duplicate reads, skip combination step) 
# umidis1: only take effect when duplicate_measure = 1 or 2, ignore this parameter if duplicate_measure = 0 or 3
#     Set 1 :if two reads from same cell barcode have same genomic location(chrom,position,strand) and their umi distance <= 1, regard them as duplicate reads and combine them
#     Set 0 (default) : regard them as duplicate reads only when their umi distance = 0 and have genomic location 
#     By default this function is turned off

non_dup_cutoff = 0.1

### Description of parameters in [Step3_QC]
# select_cell_measure: Method to select real cells from cell_barcodes, choose from 1 or 2
#     1 (default): Cell_barcodes with more than 1000 genes covered are selected as real cells for following analysis including dimentional reduction and clustering, cutoff of covered gene number(1000, default) is determined in parameter "covergncluster"
#     2 : Top 1000 cell_barcodes with highest umi count will be selected as real cells, number of highest umi cell(1000, default) is determined in parameter "topumicellnumber". Suitable for Drop-seq sample with known cell number
# covergncluster: cell_barcodes with more than 1000 (default) genes covered will be selected as STAMP barcodes for clustering
#     This parameter takes effect only when "select_cell_measure" is set to 1
# topumicellnumber: Top 1000(default) cell_barcodes with highest umi count will be selected as STAMP barcodes for clustering
#     This parameter takes effect only when "select_cell_measure" is set to 2
# remove_low_dup_cell: A group of cell barcodes have almost no duplicate reads, which show clearly different pattern from STAMP barcodes, we set an option to remove these cell_barcodes for analysis step.
#     Choose from 0 or 1, set 1 to turn on this function(remove low duplicate rate cell_barcodes), set 0 (default) to turn off(keep low duplicate rate cell_barcodes)
#     May not effective when sequencing depth is not enough.
# non_dup_cutoff: Only take effect when remove_low_dup_cell is turned on. Cutoff of low-duplicate cell_barcode (default is 0.1), a cell_barcode will be defined as low-duplicate cell_barcode if its duplicate rate < 0.1. Duplicate rate for each cell_barcode is defined as (#total_reads - #UMI)/#total_reads

### Description of parameters in [Step4_Analysis]
# dimensionreduction_method : Method for dimension reduction 
# 	chosse from 1(default),2,3
# 	1(default) : t-SNE
# 	2 : SIMLR
# 	3 : PCA
# highvarz: Cutoff for high variance selection. in the first step we divide all genes to 20 groups based on average expression level across all individual cells. Then in each group we select genes whose z-normalized CV(var/mean) >= 1.64 (default, corresponding to pvalue =0.05) 
# selectpccumvar: Select topN PC until they explain 50% (default is 0.5,  eg. 0.3 for 30% variance) of total variance. Then conduct 2 dimentional t-SNE based on selected PCs
# pctable: choose from 0(default) and 1, you can turn on this function(set 1) to output a 2 column table for PC1 v.s PC2
#     This paramter is designed for users who prefer and conduct following analysis based on PCA output
#     0(default) : Do not output PCA result, only output PCA + 2 dimentional t-SNE result (see document for more details)
#     1 : Output PC1 v.s. PC2 table in addition to t-SNE result.
# cortable: Choose from 0(default) and 1, you can turn on this function(set 1) to output a cell to cell correlation matrix
#     Correlation is based on log scale TPM(trsncript per million reads). 
#     User can turn on this function to generate cell to cell correlation matrix for custom analysis
# clustering_method: Method for cluster cells based on t-SNE output
#     Choose from 1(default) ,2 ,3 and 4.
#     1(default) : k-means, use Gap statistics followed by our "first stable Gap" method to determine k
#     2 : k-means, but use Gap statistics followed by triditional "Tibs2001SEmax"  method to determine k (Tibshirani et al (2001))
#     3 : k-means with custom determined k, k value is defined in following parameter "custom_k", this option is designed for users who know the number of subgroup of the drop-seq sample
#     4 : (make sure your R enviroment has library "fpc" installed) Use dbscan as clustering method, the (eps) parameter is defined in following parameter "custom_d"
# maxknum: Maximum k number for gap statistics, only take effect when clustering_method = 1 or 2
# custom_k: Only take effect when clustering_method = 3, cells will be clustered to N group based on t-SNE result according to user determined k
# custom_d: Only take effect when clustering_method = 4, refer to the parameter "eps"(Reachability distance, see Ester et al. (1996)) of dbscan. By default we set it to 2 according to the orginal Drop-seq paper, but it varies a lot between differen datasets.
# rdnumber: Set random number times
